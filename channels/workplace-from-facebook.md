Clicking the "Message" button will let the user start the conversation.

### Using e-mail addresses

The Chatlayer.ai Workplace app has access to a Workplace user's e-mail address. When you've connected your bot to the Workplace channel, you can use the variable {email} in your flows, which will be filled with the user's e-mail address. Read more about using variables in Chatlayer.ai [here](../tutorials/tutorial-conditional-flow-navigation.md).

### Uninstalling

If you want to disconnect your bot from Workplace, go to the Admin Panel, click on your bot integration, and click on Uninstall
