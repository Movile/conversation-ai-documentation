# Synonym entities

Synonym entities allow you to add alternatives to entities that are mapped to the same value. For example

`I want to go to Brussels`

`I want to go to Bruxelles`

The meaning of these two expressions is exactly the same, but you want to convert `Bruxelles` to `Brussels` so your ticketing system understands the destination this user wants to go to.

To do this, go to the Entities tab, and edit the entity you want to add synonyms for.
