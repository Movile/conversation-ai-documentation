Clicking **import** opens a model that guides you through the steps of importing an NLP model. In the first step you can download a template for your NLP import, and upload your filled in version.

The second step lets you choose between **adding** to or **replacing** your existing NLP model. Be very careful with replacing your model, this cannot be undone!
