# Conversations

In this module you can view all the users in a user table. By starting to type in the Filter text boxes you can filter conversations based on first name, last name or language.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Test conversations you held with the bot in the emulator will not be shown in the conversations tab.
{% endhint %}

Select a user row to see the conversation that took place between the user and the bot. You can see a timestamp for each message and in which bot dialog the message was sent.

#### Voice and phone conversations

Conversations through the voice channel will include both an audio file and transcripts of what was spoken by the user and the bot.

{% hint style="info" %}
Conversations with Chatlayer.ai voice bots are automatically recorded - make sure you inform your users about this in the voice bot flow if they haven't given their consent in another way already.
{% endhint %}
